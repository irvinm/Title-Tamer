Limitation of working on restricted sites like accounts.firefox.com, addons.mozilla.org... 
    ... any listed in about:config -> extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains
If you delete a rule, that tab title might not be change until the tab reloads or changes
    *** Force a reload of a tab that has been renamed but the rule was deleted <-- Maybe an option to enable this?
Option coloring - Light, Dark, Auto
Support for Firefox Sync (maybe except specific tabs!)
Keyboard shortcuts? (Maybe for "Rename specific tab"?)
PDF files:  PDF viewer is a privileged page that extensions cannot modify

    "Note that some special pages do not allow this permission, including reader view, view-source, and PDF viewer pages."

Matches:  
    Exact string matches
        Input as [Exact "(string)"] -> look for command, extract search term, compare against tab's URL as equal
    Contains string matches (This would include "Domain matches")
        Input as [Contains "(string)"] -> look for command, extract search term, compare against tab's URL with string "contains"
    RegEx matches
        Existing functionality
    Title matches (value?) - Exact? Contains? Other?
    Rename specific tabs (regardless of title or URL) [right-click tab options including TST - "Rename this tab"]
        Addon button: Input as [Current] -> Replace title with string, but display "Tab #xxx" in the stored table
        Right-click option: Replace title with temp string "Click addon button to change". Display "Tab #xxx" in the stored table
        Will need to monitor if this tab is closed to delete the rule.
        Will not work if tab is closed and then re-opened ... different Tab.id ... hence delete the rule when closed.
        Could do this as a pop-up ... then store in the table.
            Show URL & Current Tab Title ... text box for new Title.
        Need "toggle" for enabling/disabling on specific tab or just handle thru table?
